        <h2>About Conway’s Game of Life</h2>
        <p>
          Conway’s Game of Life is a zero-player game invented by John Conway in
          1970. It consists of an infinite grid of cells which, based on simple
          rules, can live, die, or multiply. Each cell’s fate is determined by
          its eight neighbors:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Underpopulation:</strong> A live cell with fewer than two
            live neighbors dies.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Survival:</strong> A live cell with two or three live
            neighbors lives on.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Overpopulation:</strong> A live cell with more than three
            live neighbors dies.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reproduction:</strong> A dead cell with exactly three live
            neighbors becomes alive.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Despite its simple rules, the Game of Life produces complex patterns,
          oscillators, and even self-replicating structures.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Complexity vs Simplicity: </strong>The Game of Life raises
          questions about the nature of complexity, order, and chaos.It
          demonstrates that order can emerge from disorder and that seemingly
          simple rules can lead to unpredictable outcomes. It has applications
          in computer science, mathematics, and even philosophy.
